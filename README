What to Watch

A program that utilizes datasets downloaded from MovieLens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).  The MovieLens datasets contain ratings for movies from over 900 individuals.

What-to-Watch retrieves the ratings and related data and uses the data to populate several variables.  The data is largely organized into three hashes: movies_by_id, movies_by_title and users.  The first two hashes consist of keys of movie IDs or movie titles with Movie class objects that contain movie ratings.

The program can make recommendations to users from the top-rated movies with movies previously seen removed.  It can also provide average ratings for each movie in the dataset.
